                <p>Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, 
                    observed primarily on December 25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration 
                    among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the liturgical 
                    year in Christianity, it follows the season of Advent (which begins four Sundays 
                    before) or the Nativity Fast, and initiates the season of Christmastide.</p>
                <p>
                    Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously 
                    by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and 
                    forms an integral part of the holiday season surrounding it.
                </p>

                    The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the 
                    Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic
                     prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room, and so they
                      were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news 
                      to shepherds,
                       who then spread the word.
